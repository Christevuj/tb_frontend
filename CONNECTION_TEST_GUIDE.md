## üéØ Pass/Fail Criteria

| Test | Expected | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Admin creates with default schedule | Mon-Fri 9-5 visible | ‚¨ú |
| Firestore has 5 individual days | Yes | ‚¨ú |

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: No slots showing for any day
**Check:**
- Firestore: Does doctor have `affiliations` array?
- Firestore: Does affiliation have `schedules` array?
- Console: Any errors in browser console?
- Day name: Is day name matching exactly? ("Monday" not "monday")

### Issue: All days showing slots (even weekends)
**Check:**
- Firestore: Are there Saturday/Sunday schedules added?
- Code: Check `_getDoctorScheduleForDay()` filter logic

### Issue: Wrong time slots
**Check:**
- Firestore: Verify `start`, `end`, `breakStart`, `breakEnd` values
- Firestore: Verify `sessionDuration` is "30" (string)
- Code: Check `_generateTimeSlots()` parsing logic

### Issue: Slots during break time
**Check:**
- Firestore: Verify `breakStart` and `breakEnd` values
- Code: Check break time exclusion in `_generateTimeSlots()`
