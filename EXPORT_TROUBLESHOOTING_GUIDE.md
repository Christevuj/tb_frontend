## üîç Testing Steps

### Step 1: Check Permissions
1. Go to your device **Settings**
2. Navigate to **Apps ‚Üí TB Frontend ‚Üí Permissions**
3. Enable **Storage** or **Files and Media** permission
4. For Android 11+, enable **Manage External Storage** if prompted

### Step 2: Test Export
1. Open the app and login as doctor
2. Go to **Post-Appointment** or **History** page
3. Click the green **Export** button (bottom-right)
4. Select a time range (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly, or Custom)
5. Watch for messages:
   - "Generating report..." (during export)
   - "Report generated successfully! Found X patients" (success)
   - Error message (if failed)

### Step 3: Find the File
The CSV file is saved at:
- **Android**: `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.example.tb_frontend/files/`
- **File names**:
  - `post_appointments_2025-10-01_to_2025-10-31.csv` (dpost.dart)
  - `patient_report_2025-10-01_to_2025-10-31.csv` (dhistory.dart)

### Step 4: Open the File
- The app should automatically open the file after export
- If not, use the **"Open"** button in the green snackbar
- Or manually find the file using a **File Manager** app
- Open with **Excel**, **Google Sheets**, **WPS Office**, or any spreadsheet app

## üîß Debug Mode

### Enable Debug Logs:
The code already has debug prints. To see them:

1. **Run in VS Code with debug console**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Look for these logs**:
   - `File saved at: /path/to/file.csv`
   - `Open file result: done - Success`
   - `Auto-open file result: ...`
   - `Error exporting data: ...`

3. **Check Flutter logs**:
   ```bash
   flutter logs
   ```

## üö® Emergency Fixes

### If export completely fails:

   - patientName (String)
   - appointmentDate (Timestamp)
   - completedAt (Timestamp)
   - treatmentType (String)
   - treatmentCompleted (bool)
   - hasPrescription (bool)
   - archived (bool)
   ```

2. **Verify packages are installed**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Check Android permissions in AndroidManifest.xml**:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

4. **Test with simple data**:
   - Create a test appointment for today
   - Export "Daily" data
   - Check if file is created

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Start with Daily export** - Easiest to test with today's data
