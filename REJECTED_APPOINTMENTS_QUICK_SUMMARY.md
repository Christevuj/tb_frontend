## What Was Done

   - Added check: `if (status == "rejected") return false;`
   - Hides prescription, certificate, and timeline for rejected appointments

## Result

### **For Rejected Appointments:**

**‚úÖ SHOWN:**
- Patient Information
- Uploaded ID
- Schedule Information  
- **Rejection Reason (in red card)**

**‚ùå HIDDEN:**
- Electronic Prescription
- Certificate of Completion
- Patient Journey Timeline

**Reason:** Rejected appointments never reached consultation, so these don't exist.

2. Go to History tab
3. Click on rejected appointment
4. Verify:
